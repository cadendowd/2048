This is a zip file that contains my 2048 Game in the Game.java file. All you need to do is run the main method where you will be prompted by the console to play the game. The controls are w to move up, a to move left, s to move down, d to more right. You can also restart the game with r and quit the game with q. This game will randomly generate values to put into the 4x4 grid and checks if you are able to move them accordingly.
